Welcome to my react project submission:

            Random Recipe Generator!
            
Description: 4 to 5 sentences in non-technical speak summarizing the features, functions, and goals.

    This app can be used by virtually anybody! Hungry but don't know what to make? In the mood to explore some culturally different foods? Perhaps you're just bored and want to see some cool pictures of food and read up on how different things are made! Well this app can do it all! At a single click of a button, any user will be able to generate any sort of recipe for their own preference and pleasure!

Wireframes: Mockups of your app on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

This is a mockup of what the app would look like when displayed on a desktop webpage, as well as how the app would most likely be visualized when displayed on both a mobile device, and a tablet.

Component Hierarchy: A visual tree of your components, depicting the parent/child relationships, as well as an indication of which will be class components, requiring state, and which will be functional components, taking props.

API: The API you will be using and a link to the documentation.

    The API I have selected for usage in this application is the Spoonacular API; one of the top 10 most popular food-related API's used globally, the Spoonacular API consists of thousands upon thousands of recipes, each with their own ingredients, directions, images, and much more! The Spoonacular API allows a user to generate completely random recipes, filter by nutitional value, ingredients, and so much more! 

Documentation: https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs


MVP: Your goals for MVP, including the minimum, need-to-have features of your app

    The goals for this application's MVP include the ability to randomly generate and render recipes from the Spoonacular API, as well as give a brief description of the steps necessary to create and fulfill the recipe. The minimum, must-have features of this app include the random-generating inputs, as well as the descriptive About Us page, and (in-progress)Sign-Up page.

Post-MVP: Write out what your goals are for post-MVP, including nice-to-have features that you would like to implement once your MVP is complete. (If you plan to use a component library, please link that here as well.)

    Post-MVP goals are focused around developing and completing the back-end dataframe for users to sucessfully sign-up for the app and be subscribed to weekly random recipes!
